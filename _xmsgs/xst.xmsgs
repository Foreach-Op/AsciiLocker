<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3218" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - The RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram__n0137</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
</msg>

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="3152" delta="old" >You have chosen to run a version of XST which is not the default solution
for the specified device family. You are free to use it in order to take
advantage of its enhanced HDL parsing/elaboration capabilities. However,
please be aware that you may be impacted by  language support differences.
This version may also result in circuit performance and device utilization
differences for your particular design. You can always revert back to the
default XST solution by setting the &quot;use_new_parser&quot; option to value &quot;no&quot; 
on the XST command line or in the XST process properties panel.
