# AsciiLocker
 Design and Implementation of Lock systems to the FPGA Board with replaceable password.
This project is simulating simple lock system: There is 60 seconds or 3 attempts to unlock system. Otherwise system will be locked. 
Then the only way to unlock system is Personal Unblocking Code (PUC). 
Furthermore, this lock system has changeable password. All these procedures similar with regular lock systems.
